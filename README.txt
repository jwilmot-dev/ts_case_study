TEKSystems Capstone Project: Appointment Scheduler - Bloodmobile
by Justin Wilmot 6/27/2022

Brief description: 
An appointment setting program for a bloodmobile.

Program functionality:
Users can create a profile, edit their profile, search and schedule for appointments, and manage their appointments.
Managers (bloodmobile employees/admins) can manage the appointments and connect the blood samples to the appointments.
Managers can also create new locations and new appointment slots.

The enclosed MySQL script contains some intial data population along with usernames and passowords for a test user and manager. 
See the script for details.

Program background:
A appointment scheduler had been an idea that was tossed around a few times during my undergraduate degree.  This 
bootcamp full-stack training program seemed like the perfect time to implement it as both the user and manager utilize 
CRUD commands.  My intial attempt is to keep the program simple, clean, and organized so users can find information quickly.

Program technical challenges:
All things Spring presented me with brand new challenges and was difficult at first to absorb and implement.  Technically,
this program is version 2 as version 1 was scrapped after it became a frankenmonster amalgamation of too many bits of foreign 
programs.  The good news is the knowledge from that first disaster helped me build version 2 from scratch in just two days.  That said, 
much of the security and authentication code was ported from one of our class labs.

Program next steps:
The user interface can still be finessed much more.  Managers can be given even more functionality.  An Admin role has been
created in security but has yet to be implemented.  Finally, enhanced content relating to blood donation can be added along 
with pre-screening forms and other items to enhance the appointment procedure.
